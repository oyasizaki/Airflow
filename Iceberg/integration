To add the iceberg library to Apache Airflow, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the iceberg-airflow package: First, you need to install the necessary package that integrates Iceberg with Airflow. 
   This package provides operators and hooks to interact with Iceberg tables.
   You can install the package using pip:
   pip install iceberg-airflow
   Make sure you install this package in the same environment where your Airflow instance is running.

2. Import the required modules: In your Airflow DAG file, import the modules from the iceberg-airflow package that you'll be using in your DAG tasks.
   from iceberg.contrib.operators.iceberg_table_operator import IcebergCreateTableOperator, IcebergDropTableOperator
   from iceberg.contrib.hooks.iceberg_hook import IcebergHook

3. Define your DAG: Create your Airflow DAG as usual, specifying the necessary parameters such as DAG ID, schedule interval, default arguments, etc.

4. Set up the IcebergHook: Create an instance of the IcebergHook class, which will allow you to interact with the Iceberg tables in your tasks.
   iceberg_hook = IcebergHook(connection_id='iceberg_default')
   Note that you need to have a connection configured in Airflow (Admin > Connections) with the name 'iceberg_default', which will contain the connection details (e.g., Iceberg metadata service URI).

5. Use Iceberg operators in your tasks: Now, you can use the IcebergCreateTableOperator and IcebergDropTableOperator to create and drop Iceberg tables, respectively.
   from airflow import DAG

-------------------------------------Start of dag---------------------------------------

from datetime import datetime
from iceberg.contrib.operators.iceberg_table_operator import IcebergCreateTableOperator, IcebergDropTableOperator

default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'depends_on_past': False,
    'start_date': datetime(2023, 7, 1),
}

dag = DAG('example_iceberg_dag', default_args=default_args, schedule_interval='@daily')

create_table_task = IcebergCreateTableOperator(
    task_id='create_iceberg_table',
    table_name='my_table',
    schema='name:string, age:int',
    iceberg_hook=iceberg_hook,
    dag=dag,
)

drop_table_task = IcebergDropTableOperator(
    task_id='drop_iceberg_table',
    table_name='my_table',
    iceberg_hook=iceberg_hook,
    dag=dag,
)

create_table_task >> drop_table_task

------------------------------------------------ End of dag------------------


6. Customize the tasks as needed: You can adjust the operators' parameters based on your specific requirements, such as specifying the database, location, or format of the Iceberg table.

7. Save the DAG: Once you've created and configured your DAG file, save it in the Airflow DAG directory (the folder specified in your Airflow configuration).

8 .Trigger the DAG: If your Airflow instance is running and the DAG files are in the appropriate directory, Airflow should automatically detect the new DAG. Depending on your DAG's schedule_interval, it will be triggered at the specified time, and the tasks will execute, interacting with the Iceberg tables accordingly.

That's it! Now you have integrated Iceberg with Apache Airflow, and you can use the Iceberg operators to manage Iceberg tables as part of your data workflows.
